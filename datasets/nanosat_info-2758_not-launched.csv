All  the  data  transmitted  by  the  satellite  will  be  open  for  public  use  and  will  be  published  on  the  internet. 
                                            The  second  goal  is  to  test  a  special  sensor  developed  by  PhD  students  from  Hungary  and  Japan  which  will  be  able  to  detect  gamma  ray  bursts.  These  bursts  are  the  signals  that  the  gravitational  waves  run  through  the  earths  atmosphere.  This  experiment  can  give  us  the  possibility  to  estimate  the  coordinates  in  space  where  the  gravitational  waves  came  from.
